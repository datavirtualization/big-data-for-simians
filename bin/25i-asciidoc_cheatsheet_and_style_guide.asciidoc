=== Style notes:

==== Gotchas

Make sure your codebase respects platform-appropriate line-endings, or you will constantly find meaningless diffs caused by windows/mac/unix newline rinsing. https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings[Dealing with Line Endings] on Github and http://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes[gitattributes man page] from the git project have the solution.

If you see a complaint about `section title not permitted in delimited block`, that probably indicates a block delimiter (`____`, `====`)  is hanging -- it is opened but never closed. Two common ways to do this are to import a file with markdown horizontal rule (`_____`), or to fail to remove the `======` from a git context diff block.

==== Markup

Conventions:

[[syntax_table]]
.A Table
[options="header"]
|=======
| syntax                                | docbook               | description
| `+plus signs+`			| monospaced      	| +monospaced text+
| `\`backticks\``			| `<literal>`     	| generic `literal text`
| `*+star plus+*`			| `<userinput>`   	| *+literal commands typed by user+* or `pass:[<userinput>foo</userinput>]`
| `_++bar plus plus++_`			| `<replaceable>` 	| _+replaceable+_ or `pass:[<replaceable>foo</replaceable>]`
| `_**++bar star star plus plus++**_`	| user inp+replbl	| _+user input replaceable+_ or `pass:[<userinput><replaceable>foo</replaceable></userinput>]`
| `_underscores_`			| `<emphasis>`    	|  _emphasized text_ and _new terms_.
| `'single_quotes'`			| `<emphasis>`  	| _URLs_, _email addresses_, _filenames_, and _file extensions_
| `[role="filename"]'/pathto/file.ext'`	| `<filename>`    	| [role="filename"]'/pathto/file.ext'
| `[role="citetitle"]'Hadoop'`		| `<book title>`  	| [role="citetitle"]'Hadoop'
| `*asterisks*` 			| bold text	      	| *bold text* should _not_ be used for emphasis -- use underscores.
| `H~2~O and 2^5^ = 32`			| super/subscripts   	| H~2~O and 2^5^ = 32. Subscripts and superscripts. For mathematical equations, italicize the variables: _x_^2^ + _y_^2^ = _z_^2^
| `<<double angles>>`			| `<xref>`      	| <<style_notes>>
| footnote:[This is a footnote.]`	| footnotes      	| footnotefootnote:[This is a footnote.]. Put them belly-up against text and following the punctuation -- `Hello.footnote:[hi!]` (note: this effs with emacs' markup, so during the early phases I will instead _always_ use a space; will strip them later)
| `.I am a Title!`			| figure titles 	| Titles for figures, tables, examples, and sidebars, but not sections.

===== Quote =====

Here's a `<quote>` by Tracy Morgan:

[quote]
____
Live every week like it was Shark Week

===== Images & Figures =====

See https://prod.oreilly.com/external/illustrations/[guidelines for illustrations]

Somewhere nearby is <<FIG1_syntax>> (a figure, titled and cross-referenced).

[[FIG_syntax]]

===== Code Block =====

Inline code block. You can use `include::code/HelloWorld.rb[]` to pull it in from a separate file.

Prefix each with `[[ref_name]]`

[[code_block_example]]
----
[source,java]
CODE_BLOCK_NOTE = Standard line length for code is 85 in an "Animal" book:"

STANDARD LINE_FORMAT = <<-EOF
0        10        20        30        40        50        60        70        80

Contrast the code block above with <<formal_code_example>>, which is a _formal_ code example (titled and cross-referenced).

CODE_BLOCK_NOTE = "Note that the line length is a bit longer here (90 in an Animal):"

==== Admonitions (Notes and Warnings)

Here are some admonitions:

[NOTE]

.Titled Admonition
[TIP]
===============================
We do support optional titles in admonitions (in most series).
