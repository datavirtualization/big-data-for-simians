=== Acquiring a Hadoop Cluster ===

This book picks up where the internet leaves off,
and this stuff changes so fast

==== References to help you build a real cluster ====

TODO: linkplz to resources for getting a Hadoop cluster

* Hadoop Def Guide / Hadoop Operations
* Elastic MapReduce
* Ironfan
* If you have a mac, use Homebrew and follow http://borrelli.org/2012/04/29/installing-hadoop-on-osx-lion/[these instructions]
  - be sure to set the system permissions correctly.

==== Insultingly short directions for getting a test cluster ====

TODO: make this less insultingly short

===== Homebrew =====

   `brew install hadoop`

===== Amazon Elastic Map-Reduce =====

Use the EMR console to spin up a cluster. Don't specify a job, but do tell it to stay running.

Then just log in and use it as a normal hadoop cluster.

(put a page on Infochimps saying how to get your first cluster, reference that)

===== Way too many options for setting up Hadoop =====
