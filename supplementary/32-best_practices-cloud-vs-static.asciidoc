== Cloud vs Static

* your cluster is too big and too small
* re-size mid job -- why not?
* tuning cluster to the job is way easier than v/v
* your data isn't that big (yet)
* with small teams, worry about downtime not utilization
* encourage profligacy -- humans are important, robots are cheap. "Don't want data scientist
  watching a cluster whose hourly rate is smaller than hers."
