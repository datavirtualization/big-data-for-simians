[[hashing]]
=== Hashing ===

// The notion of "randomness" is highly ambiguous at best, philisophically ill-founded at worst. It's a bunch of ideas smushed together, two of which are (I'll explain) _unpredictable_ and _information-free_.

A strong-mixing hash function does two things: produces _uniform output_, and _disperses nearby inputs_ (the "avalanche" effect).
This mixing means that in the rare case two objects have a colliding hash, they are even-yet-more-rarely likely to be similar as well. 

Suppose we say that two words are "close" when their edit distance is close (...)

Take a copy of the Merriam-Webster dictionary

* Number every term in the dictionary from 1 to N. The digest of a term is its order-index (if it's not present use the prior word alphabetically). This has bad mixing and bad LSHness, but does completely fill its space
* Instead, look up the word and count, from the top of the left-hand page down each column, until you get to the word. This
  - does a better job of mixing,
  - bad LSHness
  - does not fill out its space: some pages have very few terms, some have many, so there will be a lot more "2"s and "7"s than "20"s and "70"s.

[NOTE]
===============================
For these purposes, one good Hash function is as good as any other.
If a library for any of the  http://blog.aggregateknowledge.com/2012/02/02/choosing-a-good-hash-function-part-3/[Murmur3, Jenkins or Spooky] hashes are close at hand, use them; but you're certain to have a built-in SHA1 or MD5 generator. Those latter are not great, but they're good enough.
And when you see something ask for a "family of N digest functions", you don't need to hunt up N different _algorithms_, just N different _mixings_. Due to the avalanche effect (that a small perturbation of the input gives a large perturbation of the output) any trivial change will work
 just tack that number onto the end of the string footnote:[end, not front, due to a weakness in MD5] and digest it:

   `def hasher(nn) ; suffix = nn.to_s; ->(str){ your_favorite_hash_function(str+suffix) } ; end`   

// (btw: MD5 and SHA1 and so on are non-reversible, making them cryptographically secure; the others are much faster, but have all the mixing properties we need.)

// http://blog.smola.org/post/970128721/hashing-for-linear-functions  -- "Note that as long as the hash is good it does not matter which one you use (I have received the latter question at least twice from referees in the past. Itâ€™s about as meaningful as asking which random number generator was used for sampling)."


===============================




=== Features ===


that can be sensibly compared
  (air temperature and number of home runs are numeric and have a meaningful distance;
  flight ID or

In contrast, categorical features(The R language refers to them as _factors_).

// Make sure "Euclidean" is what we want

=== Similarity ===

* There are a few features.
* There are a dozen or a few dozen comparable features, and most of them have a value
* There are hundreds, thousands or millions of features, and most of them are zero or nearly zero:
  - in the bag-of-words representation of a document, every word in the entire corpus is a feature; the value might be a 1/0 indicating the word's presence or absence; or a measure of how often the word is used in the document (count, document frequency, or tf/idf, of which more later)
  - a problem with dozens of categorical variables might unpack to a problem with hundreds of comparable variables: census data (occupation; immigrant status; homeowner status; religion).


==== Jaccard Similarity ====

In the case where there are tons of features, it's often enough that the mere presence -- just being significantly larger than zero -- is enough to judge things as similar (or potentially similar) in that aspect.
If you're backpacking in the Yukon and you meet another traveller, you'll stop and share a drink: simply being a human being is similarity enough. Close to home, most people choose drinking buddies with similar politics, taste and so forth.

So the dumbest non-trivial way to evaluate "do they share the same topic" is
"do they use the same words". That is, consider all words mentioned at least once in either document. How many of them appear in the other document?
Since we're now just talking about presence or absence of common terms, we can use the 'Jaccard Similarity' of sets to quantify their similarity:

    JacSim[ A, B ] =  (items in A and B) / (items in A or B or both)
                   =  ||A intersect B|| / ||A union B||
//		   = TODO TeX goes here		     



=== MinHash ===


1. It's OK to compare features by presence/absence and not degree (that is, Jaccard similarity is appropriate)
2. The features are very sparse - most of them are zero.




By "similar" you might mean "potentially similar" -- you'll often use minhash to identify _potentially similar_ objects, followed a more robust similarity measure. If so, just pretend I'm saying "potentially similar".
 
Minhash uses one seemingly-blunt move to execute three data transformations at once.
. It's like watching your Grandmom truss a turkey: what you thought she did in one yank was really a combined pull-stuff-twist-extend-tuck that will take a half hour for you to recreate with guests coming over.


* Digests the feature name to a compact value: features are represented by a single machine word and not say a many-bytes-long character strings. This typically means faster comparisons, less memory usage, and less data sent to reducer.

* Truncating the digest 'folds' the feature space on itself, so that you can
  store aggregate information about features (eg counts) in a bounded number of buckets rather than an unknowable amount of RAM.

* "Randomly" permutes the feature names: the secret to how it approximates the Jaccard similarity


There are _two_ different hashings going on:

* a strong-mixing hash (eg murmur or MD5) to "consistently randomize" the features
* a locality-sensitive hash (eg modulo N) to fold the feature space


==== Process ====

* `m`: number of hash digests used to prepare the metri-fied measure
* `l`: number of LSH signatures;
* `k`: number of digests used in each min-hash signature


* Define beforehand `m` strongly-mixing digest functions as `Murmur.digest(str + idx.to_s)`.
  This performs a consistent "randomization" of its inputs.

* For each of the `m` functions,
  - apply it to every word in the document
  - choose the digest with the lowest value

This part estimates the Jaccard similarity; we've defined a metric on the features!

Next, LSH:

  Pr[ LSH(u) == LSH(v) ] == Pr[ MinHash(u) == MinHash(v) ] ** k

K sharpens the   



==== accuracy

even if the bucket for the term `also`  collides with the term `zephyr`,
  you're trusting that similarity is robust enough to shine through even without proper detection of `zephyr`.

=== Locality-sensitive hash

First, if two items are nearby, there is a high probability they hash to the same value

    Pr[ h(x) = h(y) ]    >=    P_l         for x, y such that |x-y| <= R

    "The probability        is above       for value within a 
    the hash functions      the chosen     radius R of each other
    are the same            limit 'P_l'

Second, if two items are far apart, there is a low probability they hash to the same value:

    Pr[ h(x) = h(y) ]    <=    P_u         for x, y such that |x-y| <= R

    "The probability        is *below*     for values *outside* a radius
    the hash functions      the chosen     `c*R` of each other (a multiple 
    are the same            limit 'P_u'    of the 'nearbyness' radius)

An example of an LSH is the Hamming distance using `j` arbitrary indices
  (example: fingerprint identification)

    let  J be the number of bits -- say, 32
    let  R be the "near" radius  -- say,  2  (items can differ in 0, 1 or 2 bits)
    let cR be the "far" radius -- say,    4  (c=2; items must hash separately if 5+ bits differ)
    Then for P_l = 1 - ( R / J) = 1 - (2/32) = 15/16
             P_u = 1 - (cR / J) = 1 - (4/32) =  7/8
    the hash family `h_j(x) = ((select the j'th bit of X))` is an LSH

    X can

=== Count-Min-Sketch

From http://blog.smola.org/post/970128721/hashing-for-linear-functions[Hashing for linear functions]

    f(x) = (0..i-1).sum{|acc, i| acc += x_i * hsh[ digest[i] ] * dig_sgn

where dig_sgn is a hash function onto 1,-1.



=== Brute-force k-Nearest Neighbors ===

Even if the baseball data isn't very big at 17,000 lines, brute-force comparison of each player to each other player requires nearly 150 million pairs. A walk in the park for Hadoop, but since it will give us something to compare against, let's take that walk.

=== MinHash, the Game


So one monkey just blurts out words over and over and as soon as
it's in either player's hand


you have a hand, I have a hand, we want to know how similar they are
I will take another deck, shuffle and deal out cards
when either player has that card, they show it --
  if only both have it, count in denominator and numerator
  if only one has it, count in denominator

this ends up approximating the Jaccard Similarity

=== Dimensionality Game

Another game, similar but different from previous:

Dating pool

"everyone who is {

* age, your

   age	    GPA	    Bowling-60  
            *25     max 100
    25	    75      


=== Dimensionality Reduction ===

If you're taking the dot product,
it's OK to smush some of the dimensions together.

    u1*u2 + v1*v2 + w1*w2 + x1*x2 + y1*y2 + z1*z2

    (u1-v1)*(u2-v2) + (w1-x1)*(w2-x2) + (y1-z1)*(y2-z2)

    u1*u2 + v1*v2 + w1*w2 + x1*x2 + y1*y2 + z1*z2
       - (u1*v2 + v1*u2 + ) 

But remember: if the dot product is near one, most of the coordinates of the two vectors agree.


=== Prob Production

Family of hash functions
A locality sensitive hash function is useful in probabilistically determining if two points are "close" to each other or not. However, we are limited by the probabilities. E.g. a probability of
`p1 = 0.5` does not necessarily instill a reasonable confidence that the two points are close. However, if we have a family of such hash functions, then using probability theory, we can construct functions that give us arbitrarily high probabilities.

Here's how the construction goes:
if f1, f2, ..., fn are (d1, d2, p1, p2)-sensitive, then we can AND them together to construct a (d1, d2, p1n, p2n)-sensitive hash function. This has the effect of reducing the probability.
if f1, f2, ..., fn are (d1, d2, p1, p2)-sensitive, then we can OR them together to construct a (d1, d2, 1 - (1- p1)n, 1 - (1 - p2)n)-sensitive hash function. This has the effect of increasing the probability.
A combination of ANDs and ORs can get probabilities arbitrarily close to 1. The closer we want an LSH's p1 to 1 (and p2 to 0), the more ANDs and ORs we need to perform.
