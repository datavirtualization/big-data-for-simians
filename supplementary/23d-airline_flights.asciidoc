=== Appendix: Airline Flight Status -- Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes ===

____________________
This data set is from the [ASA Statistical Computing / Statistical Graphics](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) section 2009 contest. The documentation below is largely adapted from that site.

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights appears in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, published about 30 days after the month's end, as well as in summary tables posted on this website. BTS began collecting details on the causes of flight delays in June 2003. Summary statistics and raw data are made available to the public at the time the Air Travel Consumer Report is released.

The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total, and takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed.

The data comes originally from the DOT's [Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA)](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp) group, where it is [described in detail](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=236). You can download the original data there. The files here have derivable variables removed, are packaged in yearly chunks and have been more heavily compressed than the originals.

Here are a few ideas to get you started exploring the data:

* When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
* Do older planes suffer more delays?
* How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
* How well does weather predict plane delays?
* Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?

==== Supplementary data ====

* **Airports**: airports.csv describes the locations of US airports. The majority of this data comes from the FAA, but a few extra airports (mainly military bases and US protectorates) were collected from other web sources by Ryan Hafen and Hadley Wickham. Its fields:

    iata    	the international airport abbreviation code
    name     	of the airport
    city     	city in which the airport is located
    country 	country in which airport is located.
    lat      	latitude of the airport
    lng      	longitude of the airport

* **Carrier codes**: Listing of carrier codes with full names: carriers.csv
* **Planes**: You can find out information about individual planes by googling the tail number or by looking it up in the [FAA database](http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_inquiry.asp). [plane-data.csv](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/plane-data.csv) is a csv file produced from the (some of) the data on that page.
* **Weather**: Meteorological data is available from (among many others) NOAA and weather underground. The call sign for airport weather stations can be constructed by adding K to the airport code, e.g. KORD, KLAX, KSEA.
