The NSF-supported ROAD project covers every state in the country from 1984 through 1990 (including some off-year elections). One collection of data sets includes every election at and above State House, along with party registration and other variables, in each state for the roughly 170,000 precincts nationwide (about 60 times the number of counties). Another collection has added to these (roughly 30-40) political variables an additional 3,725 variables merged from the 1990 U.S. Census for 47,327 aggregate units (about 15 times the number of counties) about the size one or more cities or towns. These units completely tile the U.S. landmass. The collection also includes geographic boundary files so users can easily draw maps with these data.

The project began as an outgrowth of earlier projects in the Department of Demography at the University of California, Berkeley, USA, and at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany (see history). It is the work of two teams of researchers in the USA and Germany (see research teams), with the help of financial backers and scientific collaborators from around the world (see acknowledgements).

s3://aws-publicdatasets/common-crawl/crawl-002

A corpus of web crawl data composed of 5 billion web pages. This data set is freely available on Amazon S3 and formatted in the ARC (.arc) file format.

Details
* Size:  60 TB
* Source:        Common Crawl Foundation -­ http://commoncrawl.org
* Created On:   February 15, 2012 2:23 AM GMT
* Last Updated: February 15, 2012 2:23 AM GMT

A corpus of web crawl data composed of 5 billion web pages. This data set is freely available on Amazon S3 and formatted in the ARC (.arc) file format.

Common Crawl is a non-profit organization that builds and maintains an open repository of web crawl data for the purpose of driving innovation in research, education and technology. This data set contains web crawl data from 5 billion web pages and is released under the Common Crawl Terms of Use.

The ARC (.arc) file format used by Common Crawl was developed by the Internet Archive to store their archived crawl data. It is essentially a multi-part gzip file, with each entry in the master gzip (ARC) file being an independent gzip stream in itself. You can use a tool like zcat to spill the contents of an ARC file to stdout. For more information see the Internet Archive's [Arc File Format description](http://www.archive.org/web/researcher/ArcFileFormat.php).

Common Crawl provides the glue code required to launch Hadoop jobs on Amazon Elastic MapReduce that can run against the crawl corpus residing here in the Amazon Public Data Sets. By utilizing Amazon Elastic MapReduce to access the S3 resident data, end users can bypass costly network transfer costs.

To learn more about Amazon Elastic MapReduce please see the product detail page.

Common Crawl's Hadoop classes and other code can be found in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/commoncrawl/commoncrawl).

A tutorial for analyzing Common Crawl's dataset with Amazon Elastic MapReduce called MapReduce for the Masses: [Zero to Hadoop in Five Minutes with Common Crawl](http://www.commoncrawl.org/mapreduce-for-the-masses/) may be found on the Common Crawl blog.

==== Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset (REDD) ====

http://redd.csail.mit.edu/[Reference Energy Disaggregation Data Set]

Initial REDD Release, Version 1.0

This is the home page for the REDD data set. Below you can download an initial version of the data set, containing several weeks of power data for 6 different homes, and high-frequency current/voltage data for the main power supply of two of these homes. The data itself and the hardware used to collect it are described more thoroughly in the Readme below and in the paper:

\J. Zico Kolter and Matthew J. Johnson. REDD: A public data set for energy disaggregation research. In proceedings of the SustKDD workshop on Data Mining Applications in Sustainability, 2011. [pdf]

Those wishing to use the dataset in academic work should cite this paper as the reference. Although the data set is freely available, for the time being we still ask those interested in the downloading the data to email us (kolter@csail.mit.edu) to receive the username/password to download the data. See the readme.txt file for a full description of the different downloads and their formats

==== The Book-Crossing dataset ====

* http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/[Book Crossing] Collected by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler in a 4-week crawl (August / September 2004) from the Book-Crossing community with kind permission from Ron Hornbaker, CTO of Humankind Systems. Contains 278,858 users (anonymized but with demographic information) providing 1,149,780 ratings (explicit / implicit) about 271,379 books. Freely available for research use when acknowledged with the following reference (further details on the dataset are given in this publication): Improving Recommendation Lists Through Topic Diversification, Cai-Nicolas Ziegler, Sean M. McNee, Joseph A. Konstan, Georg Lausen; Proceedings of the 14th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW '05), May 10-14, 2005, Chiba, Japan. To appear. As a courtesy, if you use the data, I would appreciate knowing your name, what research group you are in, and the publications that may result.

The Book-Crossing dataset comprises 3 tables.

* BX-Users: Contains the users. Note that user IDs (`User-ID`) have been anonymized and map to integers. Demographic data is provided (`Location`, `Age`) if available. Otherwise, these fields contain NULL-values.
* BX-Books: Books are identified by their respective ISBN. Invalid ISBNs have already been removed from the dataset. Moreover, some content-based information is given (`Book-Title`, `Book-Author`, `Year-Of-Publication`, `Publisher`), obtained from Amazon Web Services. Note that in case of several authors, only the first is provided. URLs linking to cover images are also given, appearing in three different flavours (`Image-URL-S`, `Image-URL-M`, `Image-URL-L`), i.e., small, medium, large. These URLs point to the Amazon web site.
* BX-Book-Ratings: Contains the book rating information. Ratings (`Book-Rating`) are either explicit, expressed on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation), or implicit, expressed by 0.

==== Million Song Dataset ====

* http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/[BETA VERSION]

The Million Song Dataset is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.

Its purposes are:

To encourage research on algorithms that scale to commercial sizes
To provide a reference dataset for evaluating research
As a shortcut alternative to creating a large dataset with APIs (e.g. The Echo Nest's)
To help new researchers get started in the MIR field
The core of the dataset is the feature analysis and metadata for one million songs, provided by The Echo Nest. The dataset does not include any audio, only the derived features. Note, however, that sample audio can be fetched from services like 7digital, using code we provide.

The Million Song Dataset is also a cluster of complementary datasets contributed by the community:

* SecondHandSongs dataset: cover songs
* musiXmatch dataset: lyrics
* Last.fm dataset: song-level tags and similarity
* Taste Profile subset: user data

An [Example Track Description](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/example-track-description)

Below is a list of all the fields associated with each track in the database. This is simply an annotated version of the output of the example code display_song.py. For the fields that include a large amount of numerical data, we indicate only the shape of the data array. Since most of these fields are taken directly from the Echo Nest Analyze API, more details can be found at the Echo Nest Analyze API documentation.

A more technically-oriented list of these fields is given on the field list page.

This example data is shown for the track whose track_id is TRAXLZU12903D05F94 - namely, "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.

There are six line-based (and two other) text files, each of them
lexicographically sorted, encoded with UTF-8, and compressed using
bzip2 (-9).  One way to view the data without fully expanding it
first is with the bzcat command, e.g.,

  bzcat dictionary.bz2 | grep ... | less

Note that raw data were gathered from heterogeneous sources, at
different points in time, and are thus sometimes contradictory.
We made a best effort at reconciling the information, but likely
also introduced some bugs of our own, so be prepared to write
fault-tolerant code...  keep in mind that even tiny error rates
translate into millions of exceptions, over billions of datums.
