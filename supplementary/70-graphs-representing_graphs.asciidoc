Assumptions:

* V fits in ram 
* E does not fit in ram
* Graph is sparse -- E/V^2 << 1 (the typical degree is smear less than V)

    {a, b} -- record with fields a and b
    <P | a, b> -- reduce able record with partition key P
    <P | S | a, b> -- reduceable record with partition key P and secondary sort key S (all objects with same P arrive to same reducer, sorted by P then S)
    <P1, P2 | S1, S2 | a, b> -- partitioned by P1 and P2, sorted by P1 then by P2 then by S1 then by S2. Objects with the same P1 may go to different reducers.
    {a, b, {(c})} -- bag field c
