// For two good reasons, we're going to use very particular language whenever we discuss how to design a map/reduce dataflow. First, because it will help you reason by comparison as you meet more and more map/reduce patterns. The second reason is that those core patterns are not specific to the map/reduce paradigm. You'll see them in different dress but with the same essentials when we dive into the Streaming Analytics paradigm (REF) later in the book, and then generalized into a conceptual model for distributed analytics in Chapter (REF). Using the terms from that conceptual model will help you see the essential core of these patterns throughout the book.
