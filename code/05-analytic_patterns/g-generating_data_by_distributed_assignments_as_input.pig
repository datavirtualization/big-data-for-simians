-- === Generating Data by Distributing Assignments As Input

-- The best way to generate data in Hadoop is to prepare map inputs that represent assignments of what data to generate. There are two good examples of this pattern elsewhere in the book, so we won't try to contrive one here. One is the "poor-man's data loader" given in Chapter 3 (REF). The mapper input is a list of filenames or database queries; each mapper expands that trivial input into many rows of output. Another is the "self-inflicted DDOS" tool for stress-testing your website (REF). In that case, the mapper input is your historical weblogs, and the mapper output is formed from the web server response.
