-- ==== Generating a Sequence Using an Integer Table
--

-- What do you do when there isn't a natural assignment to seed from (eg generating fake data to test with), or when you're trying to enumerate values of a function (every IP address, or the sunrise and sunset times by date, or somesuch)? A table of integers -- yeah, just the lines 1, 2, 3, ... each on subsequent rows -- is astonishingly useful in many circumstances, and this is one of them. This Wukong map-reduce script will generate an arbitrary quantity of fake name, address and credit card data to use for testing purposes.

# seed the RNG with the index

  idx = line.to_i
  offsets = [ line / C5, (line / C4) % 26, (line / C3) % 26, (line / C2) % 26, line % 26 ]
  chars = offsets.map{|offset| (ORD_A + offset).chr }

-- Generating random values is useful in many circumstances: anonymization, random sampling, test data generation and more. But generating truly random numbers is hard; and as we'll stress several times, it's always best to avoid having mappers that produce different inputs from run to run. An alternative approach is to prepare a giant table of pre-calculated indexed random numbers, and then use a JOIN (see next chapter) to decorate each record with a random value. This may seem hackish on first consideration, but it's the right call in many cases.
