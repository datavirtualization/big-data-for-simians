-- === Set Operations
--
-- * Distinct Union;
-- * Set Intersection
-- * Set Difference
-- * Set Equality
-- * Symmetric Set Difference

-- To demonstrate set operations on grouped records, let's look at the
-- year-to-year churn of mainstay players footnote:[using our definition of a
-- significant season: post-1900 and 450 or more plate appearances] on each
-- team.

-- ==== Constructing a Sequence of Sets

-- Since it's a self-cogroup, we must do a dummy projection to make new aliases
-- (see the earlier section on self-join for details).

y2 = FOREACH sig_seasons GENERATE player_id, team_id, year_id;

-- Put each team of players in context with the next year's team of players
year_to_year_players = COGROUP
  y1 BY (team_id, year_id),
  y2 BY (team_id, year_id-1)

-- The first and last years of existence don't have anything interesting to
-- compare, so reject them.

-- ==== Set operations within group
--
-- The content of `rosters` is a table with two key columns: team and year; and
-- two bags: the set of players from that year and the set of players from the
-- following year.
--
-- Describe the evolution of the team from year to year:
