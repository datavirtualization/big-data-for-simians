-- Recall that a GROUP operation produces records with two fields: the first
-- field is the grouping key, the second field is the bag of unchanged records
-- from the input table having that key.
--
-- The first field in a COGROUP operation is similarly the grouping key; the
-- second field is the bag of records from the leftmost-named table (home_games)
-- having that key; and the third field is the bag of records from the
-- next-named table (away_games) having that key. You can list as many tables in
-- the COGROUP statement as you like; their bags-of-records will be deposited in
-- the correspondingly subsequent slots of the output records.
