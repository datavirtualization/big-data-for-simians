-- Here follows an investigation of players' career statistics
--
-- Defining the characteristic what we mean by an exceptional career is a matter
-- of taste, not mathematics; and selecting how we estimate those
-- characteristics is a matter of taste balanced by mathematically-informed
-- practicality.
--
-- * Total production: a long career and high absolute totals for hits, home runs and so forth
-- * Sustained excellence: high normalized rates of production (on-base percentage and so forth)
-- * Peak excellence: multiple seasons of exceptional performance

-- === Using Group/Decorate/Flatten to Bring Group Context to Individuals
--

-- Earlier, when we created relative histograms, we demonstrated putting records
-- in context with global values.
--
-- To put them in context with whole-group examples, use a pattern we call
-- 'group/decorate/flatten'. Use this when you want a table with the same shape
-- and cardinality as the original (that is, each record in the result comes
-- from a single record in the original), but which integrates aggregate
-- statistics from subgroups of the table.
--
-- Let's annotate each player's season by whether they were the league leader in
-- Home Runs (HR).

-- The group we need is all the player-seasons for a year, so that we can find
-- out what the maximum count of HR was for that year.
bats_by_year_g = GROUP bat_seasons BY year_id;

-- Decorate each individual record with the group summary, and flatten:
bats_with_max_hr = FOREACH bats_by_year_g GENERATE
  MAX(bat_seasons.HR) as max_HR,
  FLATTEN(bat_seasons);

-- Now apply the group context to the records:
bats_with_leaders = FOREACH bats_with_max_hr GENERATE
  player_id.., (HR == max_HR ? 1 : 0);

-- An experienced SQL user might think to do this with a join. That might or
-- might not make sense; we'll explore this alternative later in the chapter
-- under "Selecting Records Associated with Maximum Values".
