-- === Selecting Records Having the Top K Values in a Table
--

-- Find the top 40 seasons by hits.  Pig is smart about eliminating records at
-- the map stage, dramatically decreasing the data size.

top_H_seasons = LIMIT (ORDER sig_seasons BY H DESC, player_id ASC) 40;
-- top_H_seasons = RANK top_H_seasons;

-- A simple ORDER BY..LIMIT stanza may not be what you need, however. It will
-- always return K records exactly, even if there are ties for K'th place.
-- (Strangely enough, that is the case for the number we've chosen.)

-- The standard SQL trick is to identify the key for the K'th element (here,
-- it's Jim Bottomley's 227 hits in 1925) and then filter for records matching
-- or exceeding it. Unless K is so large that the top-k starts to rival
-- available memory, we're better off doing it in-reducer using a nested
-- FOREACH, just like we

--
-- http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.12.0/api/org/apache/pig/piggybank/evaluation/Over.html[Piggybank's Over UDF]
-- allows us to
--
-- We limit within each group to the top `topk_window` (60) items, assuming
-- there are not 16 players tied for fourth in H. We don't assume for too long
-- -- an `ASSERT` statement verifies there aren't so many records tied for 4th
-- place that it overflows the 20 highest records we retained for consideration.
