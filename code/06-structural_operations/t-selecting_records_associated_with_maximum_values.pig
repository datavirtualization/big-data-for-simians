-- === Selecting Records Associated with Maximum Values

-- As we learned at the start of the chapter, you can retrieve the maximum and
-- minimum values for a field using the `MAX(bag)` and `MIN(bag)` functions
-- respectively. These have no memory overhead to speak of and are efficient for
-- both bags within groups and for a full table with `GROUP..ALL`. (By the way:
-- from here out we're just going to talk about maxima -- unless we say
-- otherwise everything applies for minimums by substituting the word 'minimum'
-- or reversing the sort order as appropriate.)
--
-- But if you want to retrieve the record associated with a maximum value (this
-- section), or retrieve multiple values (the followin section), you will need a
-- different approach.

-- For example, we may want to identify the team each player spent the most
-- games with. Right from the start you have to decide how to handle ties. In
-- this case, you're probably looking for a _single_ primary team; the cases
-- where a player had exactly the same number of games for two teams is not
-- worth the hassle of turning a single-valued field into a collection.
--
-- That decision simplifies our

-- -- -- How we made the events_evid table:

-- events_evid = FOREACH events GENERATE game_id, event_seq, SPRINTF('%s-%03d', game_id, event_seq) AS event_id, year_id..;

-- Consulting the jobtracker console for the events_final_event_1 job shows
-- combine input records: 124205; combine output records: 124169 That's a pretty
-- poor showing. We know something pig doesn't: since all the events for a game
-- are adjacent in the file, the maximal record chosen by each mapper is almost
-- certainly the overall maximal record for that group.
--
-- Running it again with `SET pig.exec.nocombiner true` improved
-- the run time dramatically.

-- -- The COGROUP version has only one reduce step, but it requires sending the
-- -- full contents of the table to the reducer: its cost is two full-table scans

-- -- plus two full-table scans for the replicated join. If we can't use a
-- -- replicated join, the cogroup version is undoubtedly superior.
-- --
-- -- So if a replicated join is possible, and the projected table is much smaller
-- -- than the original, go with the join version. However, if you are going to
-- -- decorate with multiple aggregations, or if the projected table is large, use
-- -- the GROUP/DECORATE/FLATTEN pattern.
