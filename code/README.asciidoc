=== Chapter 11: Geospatial Data

* Intro
  - mapviewer page: zoom in on English Channel (11a)

* pointwise spatial aggregation
  - grid UFO sightings by equirectangular tile_ij
  - mapviewer page to look at it (heatmap layer)
  - grid airports by # of flights
  - mapviewer page to look at it

* pointwise spatial join
  - bounding box for circle of distance
  - (code block with full bbox-for-circle-of-distance method)
  - bbox to quadkeys
  - flatten then group on quadkeys; aggregate
  - mapviewer page to look at it (layer with points)
  - mapviewer demo page: two big circles
  - labelled digram of why max long = point with tangent

* export to tileserver
  - point -> quadkey
  - polygon -> quadkey, LineString -> quadkey
  - (hbase backing?)

* projections
  - do with mercator (because google)
  - do with lambert (for equal area)
  - do with equirectangular (because x/y)
  - do with coolhat (because poles)
  - implement coolhat UDF
  - show our geographic exemplars in each
  - orthographic projection of each tile scheme on globe (with landmasses?)

* Mechanics of data
  - Geometric Exemplars
    - _snake_	   -- Open LineString of an s-like shape. Lies within dotman, its endpoint meets dotman's boundary
    - _snake_mid_  -- 2nd point of snake
    - _snake_end_  -- endpoint of snake, meets dotman's boundary
    - _bar_        -- line. crossed dotman
    - _bowtie_	   -- LineString of closed non-simple bowtie, one wing larger. touches dotman but doesn't cross.
    - _banana_	   -- .
    - _dotman_	   -- MultiPolygon of Dotman (with eye) and Dot, such that centroid is not within interior
    - _dm_outline_ -- outer ring of dotman body
    - _hat_	   -- rectangle overlaps dotman's upper half, one corner in middle of dot one corner just left of head
    - _mote_	   -- small LineString diamond that is inside dotman's eye
    - _monroe_	   -- small polygon diamond above dotman's mouth
  - Geographic exemplars
    - _reyk_ish_   -- Near Reykjavik at (-20, 65) (actual -21.9, 64.1)
    - _arkh_ish_   -- Near Arkhangelsk at (40, 65) (actual 40.5, 64.5)
    - _pt_65_10_   -- North of Oslo at (10, 65)
    - _oslo_ish_   -- Near Oslo at (10, 60) (actual 10.8, 60)
    - sardinia (40, 10) (actual 40, 9)
    - milan (45, 10) (actual 45.5, 9.2)
    - tun_ish (35,  10) (actual 34, 9)
    - _reyk_arkh_  -- line connecting reyk_ish with arkh_ish
    - _libr_ish_   -- Near Libreville at (10, 65)
    - _circ_10_65_1400_ -- circle of 1400km around (10, 65)
    - _circ_10_0_1400_ -- circle of 1400km around (10, 0)
