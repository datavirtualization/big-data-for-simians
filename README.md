## Big Data for Chimps: A Seriously Fun guide to Terabyte-scale data processing

This is the work-in-progress version of the upcoming O'Reilly book, _Big Data for Chimps: A Seriously Fun guide to Hadoop and Terabyte-scale data processing_.

Our intent is to provide the best guide for _exploratory_ data analytics using Hadoop -- for data science in practice. We use high-level languages (Pig and Ruby) that make Hadoop a tool, not a framework, allowing re-use and rapid development. We'll cover enough Hadoop internals to save you from diving into the source code, and enough tuning advice to let you know where to drill deep.

In all cases, the focus is on maximizing your time and creativity -- on helping you uncover what question to ask and the right way to ask it.
